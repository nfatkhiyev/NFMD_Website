I am an expert in medical device manufacturing. Having spent 10 years working with medical device manufacturing engineers in all phases of their projects from development to production, my knowledge in the industry will help you get to a solution very quickly. 

My primary areas of expertise are feasibility studies, design input, process development and process control. 

My ideal morning starts with a run or an MTB ride and spend time reading the Word. I take pride in the work that I do and find satisfaction in helping others succeed. I also enjoy coaching and watching my kids play and grow.

I am fluent in Spanish too.
